![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GibletsofJesus/Twitter-proj/master/TwitterIsland/Assets/myWork/textures/banner.png)<br>
Tweet Islands was created by Craig Tinney<br>
Unless otherwise specified in files, all content in the myWork is all my own production (apart from sounds and some shaders).<br>
Some of the textures used in materials were taken from [this pack.](

Other than that it's either default Unity assets or something I've put together

##Important things to do

- Stop users being able to post a posctard without the image being uploaded.

##Future goals

- Make something for replies
	- Boats / ships?
	- Other Islands?
	- Maybe a item that scales based on # of relpies...
- Android version
	- HuD
	- Controls
	- Any API problems
- Snow effect for christmas islands!
- Could release scalable cloud particle system on the asset store
- Could release Twitter cript also for interacting with the public API

##Pie in the sky

- GOLF
- Show islands from other users
- Seperate islands for PROFILES
